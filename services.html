Human beings are highly innovative. With the kind of capability they have, it only takes continued effort and focus to create and innovate. An engineering student's life in college is very precious. The future of a students depends on what they do in four years in the campus. It is during this period they can transform themselves to be somebody who will be highly useful for the society and industry. When students graduate they can contribute to the development of society around them directly or indirectly. By working for a industry he indirectly contribute to the economy of the Nation. On the other hand, by being creative and innovative they can produce and market new products which helps rapid development of our country.

It is with this intention, at NMAMIT a concept called “Summer Research Internship Program” has been initiated. The process involves inviting faculty members to come out with project ideas for the students to work with. Later on students are invited to select the project ideas and enroll for the program. After the completion of the semester end exam in the summer, students start working on the chosen topic and work for two months. The expected deliverables are the completion of the project and preparation of a research paper. The exercise culminates in a program organized to felicitates both students and faculty members.

What started as a trickle in 2012 has turned into a glut in 2020 with 453 plus students enrolled for the program. The Institution is even thinking about permitting students from other Institution to participate in the program.
